        <p><span style="color: brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the
            Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on
            rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
            gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
         <p>I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the
            production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
            If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please 
            contact me.</p>
